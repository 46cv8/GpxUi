{"name":"GpxUi","tagline":"GPX in a GUI wrapper that will probably stick to your fingers","body":"### GUI\r\n\r\n### Setting up\r\nSoon, I hope to have a Squirrel.Windows setup to install both GpxUi as well as the GPX command line tool.  So then you install by downloading and installing a release, but not yet.\r\n\r\n### Future features\r\n- Add an option to choose the default save location: a) the same place as the gcode or b) last place an x3g was produced (like to the SD card directly)\r\n- Machine settings customization\r\n- Save the settings in the gpx.ini to affect the plugin versions for slicers like Slic3r and Cura.\r\n- Help with setting up the plugins?\r\n\r\n### Development info\r\n- Using Qt as the framework to be cross platform\r\n- Using Squirrel.Windows to do install without privilege elevation.  Have to do something different for Mac and Linux.\r\n","google":"UA-65411752-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
